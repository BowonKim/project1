                <p>I grew up in South Korea and I came to the United States to study English and experience other worlds. 
                    Since I was young, I liked to do something with the computer so I decided to major in computer information technology however during the three years of college, 
                    I could not find any fields that want to study more deeply and work in the specific field. I focused on studying and getting good grades without participating in any
                    activities because I didn't know what I want to do. <br>
                    Then, while taking the graphic design and web design courses last semester, I came across web development for the first time. While developing the website for the project, 
                    it was really interesting that I could  see the results visually right away. I thought it was a perfect field that combines design and coding that I love and 
                    I could find what I want to do after graduation. After deciding what I want to do, I'm studying to improve my skills these days.
